<h1 align='center'> What this is:</h1>

Dokkautomater is almost exactly what it sounds like: a project to automate playing the semi-popular mobile game Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle using Convolutional Neural Networks.

<h1 align='center'> How it works: </h1>

The program trains on images of various menus encountered when playing through the story and from that creates mathematical generalizations that allows it to
distinguish menus from one another. This, combined with pre-programmed clicks, can let the network determine the menu it's on and then click
based on that information.
